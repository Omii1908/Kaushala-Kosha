# Data Analysis with Python (FreeCodeCamp)

Welcome to the **Data Analysis with Python** certification repository! This repository contains projects and resources to help you complete the certification from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## Overview

The **Data Analysis with Python** certification is designed to help you learn essential data analysis skills using Python. You'll work on real-world projects, gain hands-on experience, and strengthen your understanding of key concepts in data analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Familiarity with Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`
- Understanding of data manipulation and visualization basics

## Projects
To earn the certification, you need to complete the following five projects:

### 1. **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator**
- **Objective**: Build a function that calculates mean, variance, and standard deviation for a given dataset.
- **Key Concepts**: Basic statistics, list manipulation.

### 2. **Demographic Data Analyzer**
- **Objective**: Analyze demographic data from a CSV file and generate insights.
- **Key Concepts**: Data manipulation with `pandas`, filtering, grouping.

### 3. **Medical Data Visualizer**
- **Objective**: Create visualizations from medical data to highlight trends and patterns.
- **Key Concepts**: Data visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

### 4. **Page View Time Series Visualizer**
- **Objective**: Visualize time-series data to identify trends and anomalies.
- **Key Concepts**: Time-series analysis, advanced plotting techniques.

### 5. **Sea Level Predictor**
- **Objective**: Predict future sea levels based on historical data.
- **Key Concepts**: Linear regression, data trends.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional but recommended)
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scipy`
