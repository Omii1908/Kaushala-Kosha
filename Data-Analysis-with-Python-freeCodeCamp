# Data Analysis with Python (FreeCodeCamp)

Welcome to my **Data Analysis with Python** certification repository! This repository contains my projects and solutions for completing the certification from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## Overview

The **Data Analysis with Python** certification is designed to help learners gain essential data analysis skills using Python. Throughout this repository, you'll find real-world projects that demonstrate my hands-on experience with key concepts in data analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Familiarity with Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`
- Understanding of data manipulation and visualization basics

## Projects
I have completed the following five projects to earn the certification:

### 1. **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator**
- **Objective**: Built a function that calculates the mean, variance, and standard deviation for a given dataset.
- **Key Concepts**: Basic statistics, list manipulation.

### 2. **Demographic Data Analyzer**
- **Objective**: Analyzed demographic data from a CSV file and generated insights.
- **Key Concepts**: Data manipulation with `pandas`, filtering, grouping.

### 3. **Medical Data Visualizer**
- **Objective**: Created visualizations from medical data to highlight trends and patterns.
- **Key Concepts**: Data visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

### 4. **Page View Time Series Visualizer**
- **Objective**: Visualized time-series data to identify trends and anomalies.
- **Key Concepts**: Time-series analysis, advanced plotting techniques.

### 5. **Sea Level Predictor**
- **Objective**: Predicted future sea levels based on historical data.
- **Key Concepts**: Linear regression, data trends.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional but recommended)
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scipy`

## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Omii1908/Kaushala-Kosha/edit/main/Data-Analysis-with-Python-freeCodeCamp
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder and follow the instructions provided for each project.
3. Implement the solutions, test your code, and review the results.
4. Submit the completed projects on FreeCodeCamp for certification.

## Certification
Once all five projects are completed and submitted, I'll earn the **Data Analysis with Python** certification from FreeCodeCamp.
